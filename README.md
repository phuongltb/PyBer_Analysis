# PyBer_Analysis
Visualizing Ride-Sharing Data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create the following:
  - A summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type
  - A multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type
  - A summary of how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer

## Results
The analysis of ride-sharing data by city type shows that total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare are different among city types.

  - Urban cities have the highest number of rides and about 13 times higher than rural cities and about 2.6 times higher than suburban cities
  - Among city types, urban has the most drivers and about 111 times higher than rural cities and about 7 times higher than suburban cities
  - Urban has the highest fares and about 9 times higher than rural's and double the suburban's
  - Urban has the lowest fare per ride among city types and about $6 lower than suburban's and $10 lower than rural's
  - Urban has the lowest fare per driver among city types and about $2 lower than suburban's and $7 lower than rural's

Below is a screenshot of the Total Fare per city type:

## Summary
For addressing any disparities among the city types, we would recommend the following:
- Attract more drivers to ride-sharing service in rural cities
- More riders per ride to increase the fare per ride
- Increase the number of rides taken in rural cities
